We collected 3He samples (ca. 40 mL each) by copper tubes mounted in aluminum channels and sealed at the ends with stainless steel clamps. In the shore-based laboratory at the end of the experiment, 3He and other gases were extracted from the water in the copper tubes and transferred to flame-sealed glass ampoules. We measured 3He concentration using a He isotope mass spectrometer (Ludin et al., 1998). Discrete SF6 samples were taken by 50-mL glass syringes and submerged in water in a cooler until measurement back in the laboratory at the end of each day. SF6 was extracted by headspace technique and measured on a GC/ECD as described by Wanninkhof et al. (1987).
