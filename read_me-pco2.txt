We measured the pCO2 along the boat truck by an underway system based on the design of Ho et al. (1997) and incorporating the suggestions from Pierrot et al. (2009). Water was pumped through a thermosalinograph (TSG) into a showerhead equilibrator, and a high precision thermistor measured the temperature. The gas was dried by Nafion and Mg(ClO4)2 dryers, and was continuously circulated through a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR; LI-COR 840A) analyzer. We stopped the flow during measurement and vented the NDIR cell to the atmosphere. Atmospheric air was taken from an inlet at the bow of the boat through a length of aluminum/plastic composite tubing (Dekabon), and was diverted into the NDIR analyzer at specific times. We calibrated the analyzer at regular time intervals with a World Meteorological Organization-traceable CO2 standard and a CO2-free reference gas (UHP N2 passed through soda lime to remove CO2). With measured xCO2, barometric pressure (P), and water vapor pressure at water surface temperature (Vp), we calculated the water and atmospheric pCO2 by applying the following expression (DOE, 1994): pCO2 = (P-Vp) × xCO2. pCO2 values were corrected for temperature shifts in the sample from the intake point (i.e., as measured by the TSG) to the pCO2 system using an empirical equation proposed by Takahashi et al. (1993).
